## ScopeCreepCTF
Turner Bushell and McKay Fawcett's Capstone Project: ScopeCreep


# SCOPECREEP

ScopeCreep is the capstone project that will be taking place on April 19th on SUU Campus. This repo will hold the files so I can find them :)
This is my first time ever organizing something like this, so I will always take feedback! 
I do not have an expectation of the amount of challenges, but It'll need to be able to hold off a bunch of high schoolers for 6-7 hours.

STORYLINE:
Help! O.C.T.O.P.U.S. (Operations for Cybernetic Tactical
Optimization and Progressive Utilization of Species) has lost control of its AI-enhanced experiment, DURGE.
It's up to you to stop the chaos and secure the digital world.
--
DURGE is the first successful prototype of O.C.T.O.P.U.S, a secret government program that implants the smartest animals on the planet with a neural up-link, in order to more effectively spy on its enemies. This up-link was tied to an air-gapped datacenter that only gave the experiments specific tasks and specific tools. After many successful Phase 1 trials, O.C.T.O.P.U.S. moved to Phase 2: Genetically modifying octopus specicies to create DURGE. DURGE, having started with neural up-link, found slight errors in the security of the link and managed to reach out to the Internet through a Samsung Smart Fridge. Now having the knowledge of the Internet, the massive library of top secret government backdoors, malware, and secret cyber operations, DURGE escaped containment and is now wreaking havoc on the world. It is up to you to stop DURGE from ending the world as we know it!

**GUIDELINES for the CTF**
* Keep it PG as this is a high school event.
* Challenges fit into the following categories:
* Cryptography
* Reverse Engineering
* Pwn
* Web
* OSINT
* Misc
* DOSing/DDOSing challenges are out of scope unless otherwise specified.
* Include an example solution in the README of your challenge for easier testing.
* Flag format should be SC{flag}
  

**Points**
100 - Easy | 200 - Difficult | Hard - 500 | Nuts - 1000

Hints (If you think they'll need them): | Easy - 5, 10, 25 | Difficult - 25, 50 | Hard - 200 | N\A - Nuts

**GUIDELINES FOR THE FIND & FIX**
* This is intended to be similar to CyberPatriot or CyberForce
* There will be one windows box and one linux box
* Each box will have a number of misconfigurations, malware, or other things that can be considered "inoperational"
