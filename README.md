# ScopeCreepCTF
Turner Bushell and McKay Fawcett's Capstone Project: ScopeCreep


SCOPECREEP

ScopeCreep is the capstone project that will be taking place on April 19th on SUU Campus. This repo will hold the files so I can find them :)

GUIDELINES
* Keep it PG as this is a high school event.
* Challenges fit into the following categories:
* Cryptography
* Reverse Engineering
* Pwn
* Web
* OSINT
* Misc
* DOSing/DDOSing challenges are out of scope unless otherwise specified.
* Include an example solution in the README of your challenge for easier testing.

This is my first time ever organizing something like this, so I will always take feedback!
