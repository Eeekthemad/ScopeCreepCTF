Description:

    Our analysts believe the clandestine organization O.C.T.O.P.U.S. began forming in secret meetings as early as 2022. Intel intercepted from a high-ranking executive’s girlfriend’s phone led us to this peculiar stained glass image. We suspect this artwork was photographed at the very location of one of their first gatherings.

    Your mission is to analyze the image and determine where it was taken.

    OSINT teams believe a visual match might be possible—search carefully for any identifying artistic or architectural features. You only need the name of the place as your answer.

    Hint: The figure in the stained glass and the ornate Renaissance-style decoration might help you narrow it down.
