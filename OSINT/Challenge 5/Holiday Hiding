Description:
Weâ€™ve recently uncovered some critical intel regarding the former high-ranking member of O.C.T.O.P.U.S. you investigated. His real name is Dmitri Petrovich Volkov. He was the lead scientist for D.U.R.G.E.

Due to his recent fallout with O.C.T.O.P.U.S., Volkov has fled the country. We have reason to believe he is meeting up with the D.U.R.G.E. project to continue his work elsewhere. We need you to find out where he has fled too, so we can capture him before he meets with D.U.R.G.E
