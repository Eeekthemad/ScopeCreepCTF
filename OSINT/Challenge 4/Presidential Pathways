Prior to their defection, this individual operated under deep cover in the academic world, using university presidencies to experiment with subtle influence tactics. His calling cards? Structures—symbols of control and legacy. Towers, gates, and bells.

   We need to learn more about this individual. You need to trace his movements through academia. Identify the institutions where he left a mark before joining on to the D.U.R.G.E. project, and piece together his path of influence.

    His academic journey started in Utah, then moved eastward.
    He was an instumental part for building gates students walked through and bell towers they could hear across campus.
    His signature additions to each campus? Carillons and Gates.
    He served as president at three institutions where he left behind these symbols.
    In 2020, he stepped away from his last known post within O.C.T.O.P.U.S.
