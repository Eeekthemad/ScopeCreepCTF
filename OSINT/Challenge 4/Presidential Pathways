    Intercepted Message Log [#442-A]:

    "We’ve confirmed that one former high-ranking member of O.C.T.O.P.U.S. has severed all ties and is now working exclusively with D.U.R.G.E. Prior to their defection, this individual operated under deep cover in the academic world, using university presidencies to experiment with subtle influence tactics. His calling cards? Structures—symbols of control and legacy. Towers, gates, and bells."
