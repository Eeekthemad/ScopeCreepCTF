Description:

    Well done finding the meeting location. We now believe a burner device was left behind to relay updates back to O.C.T.O.P.U.S.

    We need to intercept any remaining pings — and for that, we’ll need to identify the nearest registered cell tower to that location. Use public datasets or mapping tools to find the nearest cell tower's registered ID #.
Barcelona Wine Bar – Philadelphia, PA

What to Submit:
The FCC Registration Number of the closest registered tower.
